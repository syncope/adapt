configuration files:
 - everything section name == process name MUST be lower key
 - sections name a process
 - special section: globals 
 - lists must be stated as "[]"
 - all line breaks and white spaces are ignored (!)
 
 - there is one specific reader that is the data source for the iteration ("stdreader")
 
 - are the global data specific keywords??
 
 
 
 process definition:
  - needs more thought!
  problem: a config object is "strings only", optional postprocessing limited to list-finding (via regex)
  
  - a process is defined by its parameters, in terms of type and value
  - this has to be part of the process definition: 
    at start: a name and a type, no value -> own object type

  - when the process is fetched by its typename, THEN
        - a list of parameter objects should be requested
        - this list holds the "NAME" -> if not found in cfgObject: RAISE
        - the value of the configobject entry will then be cast to the respective type -> if not possible: RAISE
        
    LAYOUT: processListBuilder finds the right type of process 
            - given by the type attribute of the configObject
            then the process.create(cfgObj) method will be called
                -> iterates over the required parameters and casts them accordingly
